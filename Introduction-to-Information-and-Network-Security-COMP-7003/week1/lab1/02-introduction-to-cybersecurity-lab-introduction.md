Morgan gathers the papers into a neat stack and slides three pages out from the report.

“These are not fixes,” Morgan says, laying them on the table. “They’re situations.”

Pat glances down. Jordan leans forward.

“They’re ordinary,” Morgan continues. “Payroll systems. Dashboards. Scheduling portals.
Nothing exotic. You’ve both seen environments like these before.”

Pat nods. “Looks familiar.”

“That’s the point,” Morgan says. “Real risk doesn’t usually hide in rare systems. It hides in the
ones everyone assumes are fine.”

Morgan rests a hand flat on the table. “Each of these descriptions includes extra detail. History,
context, noise. Some of it matters. Most of it doesn’t. Your job is to tell the difference.”

Jordan looks up. “So we’re not fixing anything yet.”

“No,” Morgan says. “We’re learning how to see.”

Morgan gestures back to the whiteboard, where the four boxes still wait.

“For each situation, I want one clear explanation of how harm could happen using the system as
it exists. No guessing about attackers. No named exploits. Just normal use, one condition that
makes the wrong thing too easy, and what actually goes wrong at the end.”

Pat flips a page. “And we do this three times.”

“Yes,” Morgan says. “Because the discipline has to hold across different systems. If it only
works once, it’s luck.”

Jordan hesitates. “What if we disagree on what matters?”

“Then we talk it through,” Morgan says. “Using the explanation. Not instincts.”

Morgan taps the last box on the board. “If you can’t say what someone would notice, you’re not
done. If you can’t name the thing that gets harmed, you don’t understand the problem yet.”

The room is quiet for a moment.

“This isn’t about being clever,” Morgan says. “It’s about being precise. When we can do that,
fixes become obvious. When we can’t, we end up arguing about severity instead of changing
the system.”
Morgan slides the pages closer to them. “Take one situation at a time. Strip it down. Produce
one line you’re willing to defend.”

Pat picks up the first sheet. Jordan opens a fresh page in the notebook.

Morgan steps back. “We start here because this is the foundation. Everything else depends on
whether we can explain, clearly, why something matters.”
