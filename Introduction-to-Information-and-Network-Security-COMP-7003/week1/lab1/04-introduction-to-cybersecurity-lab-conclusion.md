The conference room looks different after the work is done.

The whiteboard still shows the four boxes, but the marker tray now holds two capped pens
instead of one. Papers are spread across the table, edges misaligned. Someone has underlined
and crossed out the same sentence twice.

Morgan arrives last and does not sit right away.

“Alright,” Morgan says. “Let’s talk about how it felt.”

Pat exhales first. “Slower than I expected.”

Jordan nods immediately. “Harder than I expected.”

Morgan smiles faintly. “Good. Tell me where it slowed down.”

Pat taps one of the pages. “The asset. I kept wanting to name the whole system. It felt artificial
to narrow it.”

“Why?” Morgan asks.

“Because in practice, everything is connected,” Pat says. “If payroll is wrong, it’s never just one
thing.”

Morgan nods. “And yet.”

“And yet,” Pat says, “until I forced it down to one thing, the rest of the explanation was mush.”

Jordan flips a page in the notebook. “I kept changing my mind about the damage. I’d write
something, then realize no one outside security would actually notice it.”

Morgan pulls a chair back and sits. “What did you do then?”

“Deleted it,” Jordan says. “And rewrote just that part. Which was frustrating, because I wanted to
fix everything at once.”

Pat laughs quietly. “Same. Every time one test failed, my instinct was to start over.”

Morgan leans forward. “And?”

“And that made it worse,” Pat says. “I lost what was working.”

Morgan lets that sit.
“That impulse,” Morgan says, “is what creates vague security work. People sense something is
wrong and respond by widening the scope instead of sharpening it.”

Jordan nods slowly. “The weak spot was harder than I thought. I kept describing things that
could happen instead of what is true.”

“What made it hard?” Morgan asks.

Jordan thinks for a moment. “Because saying ‘is’ feels like an accusation. Like I’m claiming
certainty.”

Morgan smiles. “Yes. And security reasoning requires exactly that kind of commitment. If it’s not
true now, it’s not the weak spot.”

Pat glances at one of the scenarios. “I noticed I wanted to jump straight to classification. I kept
thinking, ‘This is obviously an integrity issue,’ before I could explain what actually went wrong.”

“And what happened when you tried to justify that?” Morgan asks.

“I couldn’t,” Pat says. “Not without fixing the damage statement first.”

Morgan nods. “That’s the point. Labels feel fast. Explanations take work.”

Jordan looks up. “I also noticed how much of the scenario I didn’t use.”

Morgan raises an eyebrow. “How did that feel?”

“Uncomfortable,” Jordan admits. “Like I was missing something important.”

Morgan shakes their head slightly. “You were doing the work. Real systems come with noise. If
you treat every detail as equally important, you never finish explaining anything.”

Pat folds their hands together. “The biggest shift for me was realizing this isn’t about finding all
the problems. It’s about being able to explain one problem cleanly.”

Morgan points at the board. “Exactly. One believable explanation beats ten vague concerns.”

The room quiets again.

“What you just practiced,” Morgan says, “is the part of security work most people skip. Not
because it’s unimportant, but because it’s uncomfortable. It forces you to be precise, and
precision exposes gaps.”

Jordan nods. “It felt like writing something that could be argued with.”
“That’s the standard,” Morgan says. “If it can’t be argued with, it can’t be reviewed. And if it can’t
be reviewed, it won’t change anything.”

Pat leans back. “I see why you made us do three.”

Morgan smiles. “Once is luck. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a habit.”

Morgan stands and caps one of the markers. “You don’t need to be fast at this yet. You need to
be honest. Speed comes later.”

The papers stay on the table. No answers are exchanged. No conclusions announced.

But something has shifted. The problems feel smaller, sharper, and harder to hide behind
language.

The work, now, is visible.
