                      Operating System
▪ An operating system (OS) is system software that acts as an
  intermediary between computer hardware and user applications
  ▪ Managing hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, I/O)
  ▪ Enforcing protection and isolation
  ▪ Providing common services so programs can execute efficiently and
    safely.
                  Major Operating Systems
▪ Unix Family
  ▪ UNIX, 1969
  ▪ BSD, 1977
  ▪ Linux, 1991
▪ Personal Computers
  ▪ MS-DOS, 1981
  ▪ Windows 1.0, 1985
  ▪ Windows NT, 1993
  ▪ macOS (Mac OS X), 2001
                Major Operating Systems
▪ Mobile Operating Systems
  ▪ Symbian, 1997
  ▪ iOS, 2007
  ▪ Android, 2008
                                    Kernel
▪ The kernel is the core of the operating system.
  ▪ Talks directly to hardware
  ▪ Manages CPU, memory, devices
  ▪ Enforces security & isolation
  ▪ Provides system calls to programs
▪ Responsibilities:
  ▪ Process scheduling
  ▪ Memory management
  ▪ File systems
  ▪ Networking
  ▪ Device drivers
                               Kernel
▪ Linux by itself:
   ▪ Cannot run commands
   ▪ Has no shell
   ▪ Has no compiler
   ▪ Has no utilities
▪ It just sits there waiting for programs.

                 Apps → system calls → KERNEL → hardware
                              User space
▪ User space is where ordinary programs run.
  ▪ Shells, Services, Scripts, and Tools
▪ It includes:
  ▪ Service managers (commonly systemd) that start and supervise long-
    lived processes
  ▪ Schedulers (cron, timers) that trigger execution
  ▪ Libraries and runtimes that applications depend on
  ▪ The programs that implement the organization’s actual workload
                                 Linux
▪ Origins:
  ▪ Linux was created by Linus Torvalds
  ▪ Originally a hobby kernel for x86 PCs
  ▪ Inspired by UNIX design principles
  ▪ An open inspectable kernel
▪ The dominant operating system for servers, cloud infrastructure,
  supercomputers, and embedded devices
▪ Important distinction:
  ▪ Linux = kernel
  ▪ GNU/Linux = kernel + userland tools
                                    GNU
▪ GNU is a collection of user-space tools and libraries.
  ▪ Created by the GNU Project (1983, Richard Stallman).
▪ GNU provides:
  ▪ Shells (bash)
  ▪ Core utilities (ls, cp, grep)
  ▪ C standard library (glibc)
  ▪ Compilers (gcc)
  ▪ Build tools (make)
▪ Without GNU, Linux is mostly unusable for humans.
                         GNU/Linux
▪ GNU/Linux = Linux kernel + GNU userland
▪ This combination gives you:
  ▪ A usable command line
  ▪ POSIX tools
  ▪ Development environment
  ▪ A complete OS
▪ GNU is not an operating system kernel and not a distribution by
  itself.
▪ “GNU’s Not Unix” (a classic hacker joke)
                        Linux Distributions
▪ A Linux distribution (distro) is a complete operating system
  package built around the Linux kernel, combined with:
   ▪ System libraries (e.g., GNU C Library)
   ▪ Core user-space utilities (GNU tools)
   ▪ A package manager (apt)
   ▪ An init system (e.g., systemd)
   ▪…
▪ Linux itself is just the kernel.
   ▪ A distribution turns the kernel into a usable operating system.
                       Linux Distributions
▪ Major Linux Distributions
  ▪ Ubuntu: General-Purpose / Desktop-Friendly
  ▪ Debian: Servers, security-critical systems
  ▪ Fedora: Developers, security learning, modern systems
  ▪ Kali Linux: Penetration testing, red teaming, security labs
  ▪ Raspberry Pi OS: Embedded systems, IoT
Linux Distributions
                                       Linux
▪ Linux is Unix-like, but it is not UNIX.
▪ POSIX is the reason UNIX and Linux feel the same.
  ▪ POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standards that
    defines how an operating system should behave at the API and shell
    level. POSIX is defined and maintained by the IEEE.
  ▪ POSIX defines what must exist and how it must behave.
  ▪ Examples of system calls and standard APIs:
     ▪ fork(), exec(), wait()
     ▪ open(), read(), write()
     ▪ signals, pipes, shared memory
     ▪ threads (pthread)
                                Linux
▪ Linux powers:
  ▪ The majority of web servers
  ▪ Almost all cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure internals)
  ▪ Routers, firewalls, IDS/IPS systems
  ▪ Android (Linux kernel)
  ▪…
                     Linux Command Line
▪ The terminal
  ▪ A terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with
    the operating system by entering commands and receiving output.
▪ The shell
  ▪ A shell is a program that interprets user commands and executes them
    by communicating with the operating system.
  ▪ A program running inside the terminal that reads what you type, runs
    commands, and prints results.
                             Filesystem
▪ Linux uses a single, unified filesystem tree starting at the root
  directory (/).
▪ There are no drive letters.
▪ Extra disks and partitions appear by being mounted somewhere
  inside this tree.
  ▪ Mounting means making a filesystem available at a specific directory so
    the operating system can access its files.
                                           Path
▪ A path tells Linux where something is in the filesystem.

             Symbol       Meaning                     Practical use

               /            Root             Jump to a system folder: cd /etc

               ~            Home             Go to your home directory: cd ~

               .      Current directory           Refer to “right here”

               ..     Parent directory              One level up: cd ..

               -      Previous directory            Toggle back: cd -
                  Current working directory
▪ Your shell is always “standing in” one directory at a time. That
  directory is your current working directory (cwd).
  ▪ It is the path in the shell that all relative paths are based on.
▪ If a command cannot find a file, first verify:
  ▪ Where you are (pwd)
  ▪ What exists there (ls)
              PATH environment variable
▪ PATH variables (usually called the PATH environment variable)
  tell the operating system where to look for executable programs
  when you type a command.
                PATH environment variable
▪ When you type a command like ls or top, the shell has to find the
  program to run.
  ▪ It does this by searching the directories listed in the PATH environment
    variable, in order.
▪ Practical implications:
  ▪ If the "command not found" message appears, the program may not be
    installed or may not be on your PATH.
  ▪ If a command runs the “wrong” program, a different directory earlier in
    PATH may be providing a different executable.
                PATH environment variable
▪ Useful commands:
  ▪ echo $PATH: show the search path
  ▪ which <command>: show which executable the shell will run
    ▪ E.g., which python3
               Some Commands (reference)
▪ Help and discovery:
  ▪ man <command>
▪ Diagnostics:
  ▪ uptime
  ▪ top
  ▪ ps aux
  ▪ free -h
▪ Filesystem capacity:
  ▪ df -h
  ▪ du -sh <path>
  ▪ du -h <path>
                     Some Commands (reference)
▪ Where you are and how you move:
  ▪ pwd
  ▪ cd, cd .., cd ~, cd –
▪ See what exists:
  ▪ ls, ls -l, ls -a, ls -lh
▪ Find things when you don’t know the path:
  ▪ find <path> -name <pattern>
▪ Read safely:
  ▪ less <file>
  ▪ more <file>
  ▪ cat <file>
                Some Commands (reference)
▪ Search inside text:
  ▪ grep <text> <file>
▪ Change files deliberately:
  ▪ cp <src> <dst>
  ▪ mv <src> <dst>
  ▪ rm <file>
  ▪ rm -r <dir>
