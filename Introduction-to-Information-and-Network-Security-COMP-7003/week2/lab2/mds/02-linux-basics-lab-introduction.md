Morgan gathers the papers into a neat stack and slides a single page to the center of the table.

“Linux Command Line Survival Guide,” Pat reads, then looks up. “That’s a choice.”

“It’s accurate,” Morgan says. “Linux becomes usable when you can do three things without
guessing. Know where you are. Move to where you need to be. Read what is there.”

Jordan leans forward. “That’s it?”

“That’s the floor,” Morgan says. “If you can’t do those three reliably, everything else turns into
improvisation.”

Pat taps the page lightly. “People think the mistakes are sophisticated.”

“They rarely are,” Morgan says. “Most damage comes from ordinary actions done without
orientation. The wrong directory. The wrong file. The wrong process. Same keystrokes, different
context.”

Jordan’s expression tightens. “So we’re not here to get faster.”

“No,” Morgan says. “We’re here to stay honest.”

Morgan rests a hand flat on the table. “Last session, we learned how to explain risk as a path.
Today is about making sure the facts under that path are real.”

Pat nods once. “Because if you’re sloppy here, everything upstream is opinion.”

“Exactly,” Morgan says. “When someone says ‘the host is misconfigured’ or ‘the server is risky,’
that is not a finding. That is a mood. The cure is specificity.”

Jordan hesitates. “Specificity in what sense?”

“In the sense that another person can reproduce what you saw,” Morgan says. “In the sense
that you can come back tomorrow and prove the change landed in reality.”

Pat glances down at the title again. “So this page isn’t trivia.”

“It’s guardrails,” Morgan says. “It keeps you from guessing when the system doesn’t behave the
way you expect. It keeps you from ‘fixing’ the wrong thing because you lost track of where you
were standing.”

Jordan looks back at the three lines Morgan quoted.

Know where you are. Move to where you need to be. Read what is there.
Jordan speaks carefully. “So the point is control.”

“Control of your own actions first,” Morgan says. “If you lose track of where you are or what
you’re touching, you lose the system before anything external touches it.”

Morgan stands and writes a single line on the whiteboard.

READ BEFORE YOU CHANGE

Then, beneath it, two questions.

What is running? What does it touch?

Pat exhales softly, approving. Jordan stares at the board as if it has finally simplified something.

Morgan caps the marker and returns to the table. “Start there. Everything else is downstream.”
