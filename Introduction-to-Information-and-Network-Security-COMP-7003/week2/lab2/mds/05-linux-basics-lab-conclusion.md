The room looks different after the work is done.

The whiteboard is still full, but the writing is tighter now. Numbers have been rewritten. A few
phrases are underlined, then replaced with simpler ones. The table is scattered with printouts
and notes, edges misaligned from being moved and rechecked.

Morgan arrives last and does not sit right away.

“Alright,” Morgan says. “What did you learn?”

Pat exhales first. “That observation is harder than it sounds.”

Jordan nods immediately. “And that it’s easy to mistake activity for understanding.”

Morgan waits a beat. “Where did it slow you down?”

Pat taps a page with a smudge of pencil. “Baseline. I kept wanting to jump to conclusions the
moment something looked high or low.”

“And what happened when you forced yourself to record what was normal first?” Morgan asks.

“It changed everything,” Pat says. “Without a baseline, everything feels like a problem. With
baseline, you can tell what actually moved.”

Jordan flips a notebook page. “For me, it was the controlled pressure. CPU, disk, memory. I
expected it to be obvious.”

Morgan’s expression stays neutral. “And it wasn’t.”

“No,” Jordan says. “It was subtle until I learned what to watch. The numbers didn’t matter until I
could explain what they meant for real work.”

Pat nods. “And until we could stop what we started. The moment we couldn’t control it, we
couldn’t trust what we were seeing.”

Morgan finally pulls out a chair and sits.

“That is the core skill,” Morgan says. “Introduce change deliberately. Observe the system’s
response. Confirm recovery. If you can’t do those three, you can’t claim you learned anything.”

Jordan looks up. “The process part surprised me.”

“How so?” Morgan asks.
“I thought I understood processes,” Jordan says. “But I had never proved lifecycle. Exists.
Touches things. Disappears. I kept wanting to assume it ended because it should have.”

Pat’s voice stays level. “And the moment we proved disappearance, the whole system felt less
mysterious. It stopped being vibes.”

Morgan nods once. “A system you can verify is a system you can reason about.”

Jordan hesitates. “The risk paths were harder than the observation.”

Morgan leans forward. “Say more.”

“I kept describing what the tool showed,” Jordan says, “instead of what would actually fail. I
wrote numbers. I didn’t write damage.”

Pat laughs quietly. “Same. I wanted to label it fast. Availability. Performance. Whatever. But I
couldn’t justify anything until the damage was concrete.”

“And what did you learn about classification?” Morgan asks.

Pat answers first. “Most of what we saw was availability. Slow, blocked, starved, terminated. It
only becomes integrity if the output is wrong, not delayed.”

Jordan nods. “And confidentiality wasn’t the story here. The story was whether work was
completed.”

Morgan lets that settle.

“The point of the lab,” Morgan says, “was not to run commands. It was to learn how to produce
a reviewable explanation grounded in runtime truth. Evidence first. Interpretation second. Impact
last.”

Pat folds their hands together. “The biggest shift for me was realizing I don’t need ten
observations. I need one claim I can defend.”

Jordan adds, “And I need to be willing to say ‘is’ when I mean ‘is.’ Not ‘could.’ Not ‘might.’”

Morgan smiles faintly. “Because ‘is’ can be checked.”

The room goes quiet.

“You should leave with three habits,” Morgan says. “Record baseline before you touch anything.
Control the change you introduce. Describe damage in a way a teammate would recognize. If
you can do those, the rest of this work becomes real.”
Morgan stands and caps one of the markers.

“You don’t need to be fast yet,” Morgan says. “You need to be honest. Speed comes later.”

The papers remain where they are. No answers are traded. No performance claims made.

But something has shifted.

They can now watch a system change, prove what happened, and explain why it matters.
