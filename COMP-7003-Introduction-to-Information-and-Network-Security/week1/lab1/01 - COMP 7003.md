          A Definition of Computer Security
▪ Computer Security: The protection afforded to an automated
  information system in order to attain the applicable objectives
  of preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
  information system resources (NIST):
  ▪ Hardware
  ▪ Software
  ▪ Firmware
  ▪ Information/data
  ▪ Telecommunications

 Figure 1.1 Essential Information and Network
              Security Objectives
                         Confidentiality
▪ Confidentiality covers two related concepts:
  ▪ Data confidentiality: Assures that private or confidential information
    is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals
    (Protecting Sensitive Data)
  ▪ Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what
    information related to them may be collected and stored and by
    whom and to whom that information may be disclosed
                  Integrity and Availability
▪ Integrity covers two related concepts:
  ▪ Data integrity: Assures that data (both stored and in transmitted
    packets) and programs are changed only in a specified and
    authorized manner
  ▪ System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended
    function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or
    inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system
▪ Availability:
  ▪ Assures that systems work promptly, and service is not denied to
    authorized users (Preventing Service Disruption)
            Authenticity and Accountability
▪ Authenticity:
  ▪ Ensuring that users are indeed who they claim to be and that all
    inputs to the system come from reliable sources
▪ Accountability:
  ▪ The security principle that mandates the ability to uniquely trace and
    attribute actions to the responsible entity

cybersecurity-notes.pdf document.
              Security Terms – Vulnerability
▪ Vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system that a threat
  could exploit.
  ▪ It can be a software, hardware, procedural, or human weakness that
    can be exploited.
▪ Examples:
  ▪ Unpatched applications
  ▪ Open port on a firewall
  ▪…
                 Security Terms – Threat
▪ Threat is any potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability
  to breach security and cause harm.
  ▪ A threat agent could be an intruder accessing the network through a
    port on the firewall
  ▪ A process accessing data in a way that violates the security policy
  ▪…
                 Security Terms – Exposure
▪ An exposure is an instance of being exposed to losses.
  ▪ A vulnerability exposes an organization to possible damages.
▪ Examples:
  ▪ If password management rules are not enforced, the organization is
    exposed to the possibility of having users’ passwords compromised and
    used in an unauthorized manner.
  ▪ If an organization does not have its wiring inspected and does not put
    proactive fire prevention steps into place, it exposes itself to potentially
    devastating fires.
                  Security Terms – Attack
▪ An attack is an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in order to
  compromise an asset, resulting in a violation of security goals.
▪ Examples:
  ▪ Eavesdropping on network traffic
  ▪ Packet sniffing
  ▪ Traffic analysis
  ▪ Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack
  ▪ Replay attack
  ▪ Denial-of-Service (DoS)
  ▪…
                         Passive Attack
▪ A passive attack attempts to learn or make use of information
  from the system
  ▪ Does not affect system resources
  ▪ Release of message contents and Traffic analysis
▪ Passive attacks are very difficult to detect
  ▪ Because they do not involve any alteration of the data
                         Active Attack
▪ An active attack attempts to alter system resources or affect
  their operation
  ▪ Involves some modification of the data stream or the creation of a
    false stream, can be subdivided into four categories:
     1. Masquerade
     2. Replay
     3. Modification of messages
     4. Denial of service
                        Active Attack
▪ Difficult to prevent because of                   • Takes place when one entity
                                                      pretends to be a different entity
  the wide variety of potential      Masquerade     • Usually includes one of the other
                                                      forms of active attack
  physical, software, and
  network vulnerabilities                           • Involves the passive capture of a
                                                      data unit and its subsequent
                                       Replay         retransmission to produce an
                                                      unauthorized effect



▪ Goal is to detect attacks and to                  • Some portion of a legitimate
                                     Modification     message is altered, or messages
  recover from any disruption or     of messages      are delayed or reordered to
                                                      produce an unauthorized effect

  delays caused by them
                                      Denial of     • Prevents or inhibits the normal use
                                                      or management of
                                       service        communications facilities
          Security Terms – Countermeasure
▪ A control, or countermeasure, is put into place to mitigate
  (reduce) the potential risk.
  ▪ Strong password management
  ▪ Firewalls
  ▪ A security guard
  ▪ Access control mechanisms
  ▪ Encryption
  ▪ Security awareness training
  ▪…
                  Security Terms – Asset
▪ An asset is anything of value to an organization that must be
  protected because its loss, compromise, or damage would
  negatively impact the organization.
  ▪ Customer data
  ▪ Servers and networking equipment
  ▪ Operating systems
  ▪ Databases
  ▪…
                      Security Terms – Risk
▪ A risk is the likelihood of a threat source exploiting a
  vulnerability and the corresponding business impact.
   ▪ Risk ties the vulnerability, threat, and likelihood of exploitation to the
     resulting business impact.
▪ A security risk is a path to a specific asset that results in
  observable damage.
▪ Every meaningful security concern can be explained as:

            Asset → Entry Point → Weak Spot → Damage
                        Threat Model
▪ Threat modeling is the process of identifying and reviewing paths
  to assets that could lead to damage.
▪ STRIDE is a framework for classifying security threats by the kind
  of harm they cause.
           Asset (what must not be harmed)
▪ An asset is a specific system object or function that matters.
  ▪ A database table containing customer records
  ▪ A payroll calculation function
  ▪ A report generation pipeline
  ▪…
     Entry Point (where typical activity begins)
▪ An entry point is a routine, legitimate way to start an interaction
  ▪ A user logging in
  ▪ A scheduled background job
  ▪ A support workflow
▪ Entry points (workflows):
  ▪ “User authentication workflow”
  ▪ “Administrative task scheduler”
▪ Not entry points (attacks, not workflows):
  ▪ “SQL injection on the login form”
Weak Spot (the condition that lowers resistance)
▪ A weak spot is a present-tense condition that exists right now.
  ▪ Access is broader than responsibility
  ▪ Changes can occur without review or evidence
  ▪ State transitions lack authorization checks
  ▪…
         Damage (what actually goes wrong)
▪ Damage is the observable outcome if the path completes.
▪ Good damage descriptions:
  ▪ “Invoices contain incorrect totals.”
  ▪ “Private records are visible to unauthorized staff.”
  ▪ “Reports are not delivered before the deadline.”
▪ Bad damage descriptions:
  ▪ “The system is compromised.”
  ▪ “This could be hacked.”
                 Network Vulnerabilities
▪ Network vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a network’s
  design, configuration, implementation, or operation that can be
  exploited by an attacker.
  ▪ Misconfigured firewalls or routers
  ▪ Unpatched network services
  ▪ Weak or unencrypted network protocols
  ▪ Open or unused ports
  ▪ Poor network segmentation
  ▪…
                    Code Vulnerabilities
▪ Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in software
  design, implementation, or configuration that can be exploited
  by an attacker.
▪ These issues can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code,
  gain unauthorized access, or manipulate data
  ▪ Such as buffer overflows and SQL injection flaws, can be particularly
    damaging in software development
  ▪ Secure coding practices, such as proper input validation and memory
    management, mitigate these risks and ensure application security
                      Social engineering
▪ Attacks psychologically manipulate people into doing things
  that they shouldn't do, like downloading malware
  ▪ Most common one, Phishing attack, involves tricking individuals into
    revealing personal information or installing malware through
    deceptive emails or messages
▪ It remains one of the most effective methods for attackers to
  gain initial access to systems
▪ Phishing was the leading infection vector, identified in 41% of
  incidents, making it the most common initial attack vector
  (IBM)
                           Malware
▪ Malware short for “malicious software” is a software that is
  written intentionally to harm a computer system or its users
  ▪ Almost every modern cyberattack involves some type of malware
▪ Types of Malware:
  ▪ Viruses
  ▪ Worms
  ▪ Trojan horses
  ▪ Ransomwares
  ▪ …
                               Virus
▪ Virus is malicious code that hijacks legitimate software to do
  damage and spread copies of itself
▪ Viruses can't act on their own
  ▪ They hide snippets of their code in other executable programs
▪ When a user starts the program, the virus begins running, too
▪ Viruses are usually designed to delete important data, disrupt
  normal operations, and spread copies of themselves to other
  programs on the infected computer
                               Worms
▪ Worms are self-replicating malicious programs that can spread
  between apps and devices without human interaction
  ▪ Compared to a virus, which can only spread if a user runs a
    compromised program
▪ While some worms do nothing more than spread, many have
  more severe consequences
  ▪ For example, the WannaCry ransomware, which caused an estimated
    USD 4 billion in damages, was a worm that maximized its impact by
    automatically spreading between connected devices (IBM)
                            Trojans
▪ Trojan horses disguise themselves as useful programs or hide
  within legitimate software to trick users into installing them.
                          Ransomware
▪ Ransomware locks up a victim's devices or data and demands a
  ransom payment, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, to
  unlock them
▪ Cybercriminals may use additional tactics to increase the
  pressure on victims
  ▪ In a double extortion attack, cybercriminals steal data and threaten
    to leak it if they're not paid
                  Denial of Service (DoS)
▪ DoS attacks aim to make systems or networks unavailable by
  overwhelming them with traffic or triggering crashes
▪ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve multiple
  compromised systems flooding a target
  ▪ Making them even more difficult to defend against
▪ Some common types:
  ▪ Application layer attacks (HTTP Flood)
  ▪ Protocol attacks
            The OSI Security Architecture
▪ Security attack: Any action that compromises the security of
  information owned by an organization
▪ Security mechanism: A process (or a device incorporating such
  a process) that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from
  a security attack
▪ Security service: A processing or communication service that
  enhances the security of the data processing systems and the
  information transfers of an organization. The services are
  intended to counter security attacks, and they make use of one
  or more security mechanisms to provide the service

                             Authentication
▪ Concerned with assuring that a communication is authentic
  ▪ A single message: assures the recipient that the message is from the
    source that it claims to be from
  ▪ Ongoing interaction: assures the two entities are authentic and that
    the connection is not interfered with in such a way that a third party
    can masquerade as one of the two legitimate parties

                     Two specific authentication services are defined in X.800:

              •Peer entity authentication
              •Data origin authentication
                       Access Control
▪ These controls restrict who can access information or systems
  based on roles, responsibilities, and the principle of least
  privilege
▪ To achieve this, each entity trying to gain access must first be
  identified, or authenticated, so that access rights can be
  tailored to the individual
▪ This approach ensures minimizing the risk of insider threats
  and unauthorized access
                     Data Confidentiality
▪ The protection of transmitted data from passive attacks
  ▪ Broadest service protects all user data transmitted between two
    users over a period of time
▪ The protection of traffic flow from analysis
  ▪ This requires that an attacker not be able to observe the source and
    destination, frequency, length, or other characteristics of the traffic
    on a communications facility
                         Data Integrity
▪ Can apply to a stream of messages, a single message, or
  selected fields within a message
  ▪ Connection-oriented integrity service deals with a stream of
    messages and assures that messages are received as sent with no
    duplication, insertion, modification, reordering, or replays
  ▪ A connectionless integrity service deals with individual messages
    without regard to any larger context and generally provides
    protection against message modification only
                       Nonrepudiation
▪ Prevents either sender or receiver from denying a transmitted
  message
  ▪ When a message is sent, the receiver can prove that the alleged
    sender in fact sent the message
  ▪ When a message is received, the sender can prove that the alleged
    receiver in fact received the message
                      Availability service
▪ Availability
  ▪ The property of a system or a system resource being accessible and
    usable upon demand by an authorized system entity
▪ Availability service
  ▪ One that protects a system to ensure its availability
  ▪ Addresses the security concerns raised by denial-of-service attacks
  ▪ Depends on proper management and control of system resources
                             Firewall
▪ Firewalls are a barrier between trusted and untrusted
  networks, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on
  predefined security rules
  ▪ A hardware and/or software capability that limits access between a
    network and devices attached to the network
  ▪ In accordance with a specific security policy
▪ The firewall acts as a filter using a set of rules based on traffic
  content and/or traffic pattern
                                Firewall
▪ Different types of firewalls:
  ▪ Packet filtering
  ▪ Stateful inspection
  ▪ Next-generation firewalls
▪ Each type of firewall has its strengths and is suitable for
  different scenarios
  ▪ Selecting the appropriate one based on specific needs is vital for
    effective protection
      Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
▪ IDS: Hardware or software products that gather and analyze
  information from various areas within a computer or a network
  for the purpose of finding
  ▪ Providing real-time or near-real-time warning of, attempts to access
    system resources in an unauthorized manner
▪ IPS: Hardware or software products designed to detect
  intrusive activity and attempt to stop the activity, ideally
  before it reaches its target
                        Attack surface
▪ Consists of the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a
  system
  ▪ Network attack surface
  ▪ Software attack surface
  ▪ Human attack surface
  ▪…
       The Challenges of Computer Security
1. Security is not simple
2. Potential attacks on the security features need to be
   considered
3. Procedures used to provide particular services are often
   counter-intuitive
4. It is necessary to decide where to use the various security
   mechanisms
5. Requires constant monitoring
6. Is too often an afterthought
       The Challenges of Computer Security
7. Security mechanisms typically involve more than a particular
   algorithm or protocol
8. Security is essentially a battle of wits between a perpetrator
   and the designer
9. Little benefit from security investment is perceived until a
   security failure occurs
10.Strong security is often viewed as an impediment to efficient
   and user-friendly operation
