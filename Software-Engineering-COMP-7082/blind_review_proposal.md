## Part Two: Project Information (Product Vision)

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FOR** | Students, Jobseekers, and Self-Learners |
| **WHO** | Struggle to get unbiased, high-quality, and constructive feedback on their writing, resumes, or projects |
| **THE** | **Blind Review** is a double-blind peer review platform |
| **THAT** | Anonymizes submissions and intelligently matches peers based on skill level, ensuring feedback is evaluated solely on quality rather than personal bias |
| **UNLIKE** | Traditional classroom peer reviews or open forums (like Reddit) where bias, friendship, or reputation skews feedback and quality is inconsistent |
| **OUR PRODUCT** | Guarantees fairness through a "reputation-based" system where reviewers are rated on the helpfulness of their critique, incentivizing high-effort, objective feedback. |

## Part Three: Epics (High-Level User Stories)

These Epics represent the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Blind Review.

### Epic 1: Anonymous Submission & Distribution
**As a** User (Author),  
**I want** to upload my draft anonymously and have it automatically distributed to a matched peer,  
**So that** I can receive unbiased feedback without fear of judgement based on my identity.

### Epic 2: Structured Peer Review
**As a** Reviewer,  
**I want** to view an assigned submission and provide feedback using a structured template (e.g., specific prompts for clarity, structure, argument),  
**So that** my feedback is constructive, actionable, and easy for the author to digest.

### Epic 3: Quality Assurance & Reputation
**As a** User (Feedback Receiver),  
**I want** to rate the helpfulness of the feedback I received,  
**So that** high-quality reviewers are rewarded with "Reputation Points" (credits) and poor/AI-generated feedback is flagged for moderation.

### Epic 4: Instructor Oversight (Dashboard)
**As a** Teacher/Admin,  
**I want** to see a dashboard of who has submitted and reviewed, including flagged "suspicious" (potential AI) reviews,  
**So that** I can monitor class participation and ensure academic integrity.
