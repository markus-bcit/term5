## Slide 1
Agile Software Engineering Fatemeh Riahi Based on Ian Sommerville 2018

## Slide 2
Before Agile: The era of plan driven Development Plan Driven Development For  example : Aircraft control systems Detailed development process, rigorous planning, system modeling before even stating the development  Doesn’t support rapid development

## Slide 3
Agile Manifest To address the problems of plan driven development individuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over comprehensive documentation;  customer collaboration over contract negotiation; responding to change over following a plan

## Slide 4
Incremental Development 

## Slide 5
Incremental Development

## Slide 6
Agile Principles  Involve the customer Embrace change Develop and deliver incrementally Maintain simplicity Focus on people, not things 

## Slide 7
Examples of different agile methods: Scrum Kanban Extreme Programming Feature Driven development Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

## Slide 8
Extreme Programming  The most influential work that has changed software development.

## Slide 9
Scrum Scrum is an agile method that provides a framework for agile project organization and planning. It does not mandate any specific technical practices.  It focuses on delivering products in iterative cycles called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks.

Benefits of using scrum 

## Slide 13
Key Scrum Practices  Product backlog This is a to-do list of items to be implemented that is reviewed and updated before each sprint. Timeboxed sprints Fixed-time (2-4 week) periods in which items from the product backlog are implemented, Self-organizing teams Self-organizing teams make their own decisions and work by discussing issues and making decisions by consensus.

## Slide 14
Product Backlog The product backlog is a list of what needs to be done to complete the development of the product.  The items on this list are called product backlog items (PBIs).  The product backlog may include a variety of different items such as product features to be implemented, user requests, essential development activities and desirable engineering improvements.   The product backlog should always be prioritized so that the items that be implemented first are at the top of the list.  

## Slide 15
Example of Product backlog Story Priority Estimate Stage Description Create Account High 8 Ready for implementation As a new User I want to create and account so that I can make purchases and track order history  Appy discount codes Med. 5 Ready for refinement As a user I want to apply discount codes at checkout so I can receive discounts on my purchase Product wish list Low. 3 Ready for consideration As a user I want to save products to a  wishlist  so that I can purchase  them later

## Slide 16
PBL states Ready for consideration 	 Ready for refinement 	 Ready for implementation

## Slide 20
MoSCoW example: Human body Must – a heart is “must”. Without it, there is no live organism. What is must in your application? Should – a hand is “should”. Without it is hard. But you can survive even without hand. Well, in most cases. Could – hair is “could”. It is fine to have them, you even look nicer, but you will survive without them Won’t  – unnecessary waste. Btw, is there anything “won’t” in a body? (Probably, it might be your appendix?)

## Slide 21
Estimation metrics  Effort required Number of hours or days that takes one person to implement Story points  Size of the task, complexity, technology, unknown characteristics Team agreement 

## Slide 22
Time boxed Sprints	 Products are developed in a series of sprints, each of which delivers an increment of the product or supporting software.  Sprints are short duration activities (1-4 weeks) and take place between a defined start and end date. Sprints are timeboxed, which means that development stops at the end of a sprint whether or not the work has been completed. During a sprint, the team work on the items from the product backlog.

## Slide 24
Sprint Activities

## Slide 25
Sprint Planning   Establish an agreed sprint goal Sprint goals may be focused on software functionality, support or performance and reliability,. Decide on the list of items from the product backlog that should be implemented Create a sprint backlog.  This is a more detailed version of the product backlog that records the work to be done during the sprint During a sprint, the team have daily meetings (scrums) to coordinate their work.

## Slide 26
Sprint Goals

## Slide 27
Scrum meeting	 Short daily meeting What people have worked on If they are being blocked. Individual are responsible to tidy up the spring backlog by removing items or moving them to Done state

## Slide 28
Scrum execution	 Doesn’t suggest any specific technical activity, but here some best practices: Code reviews Unit and integration  and acceptance tests Test automation (future session) Continues integration

## Slide 29
Sprint Reviews Whether or not the goal is met Set out new discovered problems How can they improve the way they work
