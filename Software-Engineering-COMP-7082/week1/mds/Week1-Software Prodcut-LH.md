## Slide 16
Product Vision The starting point for software product development is a ‘product vision’. The product vision should answer three fundamental questions: What is the product to be developed? Who are the target customers and users? Why should customers buy this product? 16

## Slide 17
Moore’s Vision Template FOR (target customer) WHO (statement of the need or opportunity) The (PRODUCT NAME) is a (product category) THAT (key benefit, compelling reason to buy) UNLIKE (primary competitive alternative) OUR PRODUCT  (statement of primary differentiation) 17

## Slide 26
Takeaways! Software products are software systems that include general functionality that is likely to be useful to a wide range of customers.  In product software engineering, the same company is responsible for deciding on the features that should be part of the product and the implementation of these features. Software products may be delivered as stand-alone systems running on the customer’s computers, hybrid systems or service-based systems. In hybrid systems, some features are implemented locally and others are accessed over the Internet.  All product features are remotely accessed in service-based products. A product vision should succinctly describe what is to be developed, who are the target customers for the product and why they should buy the product that you are developing. Domain experience, product experience, customer experience and an experimental software prototype may all contribute to the development of the product vision. 26

## Slide 27
Takeaways! Key responsibilities of product managers are product vision ownership, product roadmap development, creating user stories and the product backlog, customer and acceptance testing and user interface design. Product managers work at the interface between the business, the software development team and the product customers. They facilitate communications between these groups. You should always develop a product prototype to refine your own ideas and to demonstrate the planned product features to potential customers 27
