   Course Description
   ​ his course offers an in-depth study of Database System Concepts and Architectures including, query processing, query
   T
   optimization, transaction processing, concurrency control, recovery, parallel databases, distributed databases and access
   control. Design of storage and file structures including different indexing and hashing organizations are also discussed.
   ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) property and non-ACID complied database are discussed. Various
   database languages are discussed including Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
   Comparative analysis with alternative data models and database systems is conducted. Assignments will reinforce
   learning through designing and constructing a database from conceptual, to logical model to final physical deployment.


   Course Learning Outcomes/Competencies
   Upon successful completion, the student will be able to:

            Design effective relational data models and database deployment architectures based on the storage requirements
            of an application.
            Facilitate data storage and access by designing suitable SQL statements.
            Evaluate efficiency of non-relational data models such as extended-relational, object-oriented and JSON/XML in
            addressing the data storage needs in comparison to relational database systems.
            Develop storage structures suitable for temporal and spatial data.
            Use indexes, RAID, query optimizers, and apply schemes such as data partitioning to ensure that data retrieval
            meets the performance requirements.
            Use indexes, RAID, query optimizers, and apply schemes such as data partitioning to ensure that data retrieval
            meets the performance requirements.
            Apply integrity constraints and other functional dependencies to ensure data integrity.
            Utilize recovery logs and implement RAID and replicated database architectures for recovery and fault tolerance.
            Develop native, web and mobile apps that integrate with the database systems to evaluate effectuality of the
            underlying database in addressing the OLTP requirements.

   Attendance
   In case of illness or other unavoidable cause of absence, the student must communicate as soon as possible with their
   instructor or Program/Department Head, stating the reason for the absence. When absences result in missed safety
   requirements, exams, or other deadlines, an instructor or Program/Department Head may request appropriate supporting
   documentation, including a medical note. For all other absences, the student is responsible to ensure they seek out
   missed information, preferably from a classmate or recording (when available). Please see BCIT Policy 5101 - Student
   Regulations [6] , and accompanying procedures, for more information.

   Attempts
   As stated in BCIT Policy 5103 - Student Evaluation [7] , students must successfully complete a course within a maximum
   of three (3) attempts at the course. Students with two attempts in a single course will be allowed to repeat the course
   only upon permission from the Associate Dean. Students who have not successfully completed a course within three
   attempts will not be eligible to graduate from their respective program. For those courses or programs that have
   Education Council approval, the number of attempts as stated in the evaluation section of the course outline shall apply.

   Academic Integrity
   It is the responsibility of all students to be familiar with the Student Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of the Code,
