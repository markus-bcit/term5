# Week 1 OS Cram Sheet (Strict Definitions)

## 1. Computer System Components (The "Four")
1.  **Hardware:** Processor, Main Memory, I/O Module, System Bus.
2.  **Operating System:** Controls and coordinates the use of hardware among various applications and users.
3.  **System & Application Programs:** Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve computing problems.
4.  **Users:** People, machines, other computers.

## 2. OS Objectives
*   **Convenience:** Makes the computer more convenient to use.
*   **Efficiency:** Allows computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
*   **Ability to Evolve:** Permits development, testing, and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.

## 3. Registers (The "Specifics")
*   **MAR (Memory Address Register):** Contains the **specific address** in memory for the next read or write.
*   **MBR (Memory Buffer Register):** Contains the **data** to be written into memory or read from memory.
*   **I/OAR (I/O Address Register):** Specifies a **particular I/O device**.
*   **I/OBR (I/O Buffer Register):** Used for the **exchange of data** between an I/O module and the processor.

## 4. Interrupt Classes (The "Causes")
*   **Program Interrupt:** Generated by some **condition** that occurs as a result of an instruction execution (e.g., overflow, division by zero).
*   **Timer Interrupt:** Generated by a **timer** within the processor. Allows the OS to perform functions on a regular basis.
*   **I/O Interrupt:** Generated by an **I/O controller**, to signal normal completion or to signal a variety of error conditions.
*   **Hardware Failure:** Generated by a **failure**, such as power failure or memory parity error.

## 5. I/O Techniques (The "Efficiency")
*   **Programmed I/O:** Processor **periodically checks** the status of the I/O module until it is done. (Least efficient).
*   **Interrupt-Driven I/O:** Processor issues command and **continues other work**. I/O module interrupts when done. (More efficient, but processor still handles data transfer).
*   **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** Processor is only involved at the **beginning and end**. The DMA module transfers data directly to/from memory. (Most efficient).

## 6. Multiprocessing
*   **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** Two or more similar processors of **comparable capability** that share access to I/O and memory, and are connected by a bus.
*   **Multicore:** A single chip (socket) containing **multiple processors** (cores).
