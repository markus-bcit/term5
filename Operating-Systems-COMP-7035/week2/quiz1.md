Hi all,


I finally had a chance to go over your grades, apologies for the delay.

I've posted the correct answers below since I had to make some modifications to the grading.

I noticed some questions were badly phrased, and as a result gave everyone full marks.

I'll schedule a bit more time in my calendar for making your quizzes for the upcoming weeks so things go more smoothly in future.

F          The ABI defines the repertoire of machine language instructions that a
computer can follow. 

 

T          The OS is an interface between applications and hardware.
 

F          The phrase control is returned to the monitor means that the processor is fetching and executing instructions in a user program.
 

 

  A special type of programming language used to provide instructions to the monitor
  is __________ .

 

                        A) ABI                        B) JCL correct

 

                        C) SML                       D) SMP

 

 

  A user program executes in a __________ , in which protected areas of memory can be accessed  and privileged instructions may be executed.
*Badly phrased question everyone got full marks

 

            A) kernel mode correct                       B) user mode

 

            C) task mode                                       D) batch mode

 

 

 

  __________ is where the OS may need to discriminate among different classes of jobs with
different service requirements

 

A) Differential responsiveness correct                       B) Process isolation

 

C) Support of modular programming                         D) Protection and access control 

 

 

T          A system bus provides for communication among processors, main memory and I/O modules.
 

T          The interrupt can occur at any time and therefore at any point in the execution of a user program.
 

*Another badly written question (everyone got full marks)
 

The program counter (PC) contains the address of instruction to be executed next.

Is the correct definition for program counter

 

 

The __________ is used for the exchange of data between an I/O module and the processor
 

A) I/O address register                       B) memory address register

 

C) I/O buffer register correct             D) memory buffer register

 

 

Nonvolatile memory used to store program and data files:
 

A) Secondary correct              B) Main 

 

C) Cache                                 D) Block

 

 

Which is not a key characteristic of memory:
 

A) Capacity    B) Function correct

 

C) Cost            D) Access Time
