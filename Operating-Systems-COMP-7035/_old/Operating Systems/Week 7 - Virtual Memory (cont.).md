D
Assume that there are 5 proceses, P0 to P5 and 4 types of resources. At T0 we have the following systems state

Max instance of Resource A = 3 (2 Allocated + 1 Available)
Max instance of Resource B = 17 (12 Allocated + 5 Available)
Max instance of Resource C = 16 (14 Allocated + 2 Available)
Max instance of Resource D = 12 (12 Allocated + 0 Available)
