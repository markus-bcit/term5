Note: these are my notes about how the instructor is going to mark questions on the quizzes/tests, from what I've heard she;s very particular on definitions, i.e. if you miss a word then you might not even get partial marks

- Heavy on exact definitions
- Go into detail about communication (see service bus) "If it's right then you'll get full marks"

This'll be updated as I've seen more questions on tests/quizzes
